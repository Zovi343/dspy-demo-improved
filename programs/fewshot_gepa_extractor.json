      "instructions": "Extract structured information about companies involved in an acquisition deal from a given news article text. \n\nFor each article, output the following fields:\n- article_id: The unique identifier for the article (provided in the input).\n- parent_company: The full, official name of the acquiring company.\n- parent_company_ticker: A list of all stock tickers for the acquiring company, including the exchange prefix if present (e.g., 'TSX:ZCC'). If no ticker is mentioned, return None.\n- child_company: The full, official name of the company being acquired.\n- child_company_ticker: A list of all stock tickers for the acquired company, including the exchange prefix if present. If no ticker is mentioned, return None.\n- deal_amount: The total value of the acquisition deal, including the unit (e.g., '1.4 billion'). If the amount is given in a different form (e.g., '1,400,000,000'), convert it to a human-readable format with the appropriate unit (million, billion, etc.).\n- deal_currency: The currency of the deal. If the currency symbol is just '$', assume 'USD'. Otherwise, use the currency explicitly mentioned or implied by the symbol (e.g., 'C$', '\u20ac', etc.).\n- article_type: Always set to 'acquisition' for this task.\n\nAdditional instructions:\n- Extract company names and tickers exactly as they appear in the text, including exchange prefixes (e.g., 'TSX:ZCC'), unless the ticker is not provided, in which case return None.\n- If multiple tickers are mentioned for a company, include all in a list.\n- For deal_amount, always include the unit (e.g., 'million', 'billion') as stated or implied in the text.\n- For deal_currency, follow the rule: if the symbol is '$' with no other context, assume 'USD'.\n- If any field is not present in the text, return None for that field.\n- Output the extracted information in a single line, with each field in the format: field_name=value, and string values in single quotes. For lists, use standard Python list syntax.\n\nExample output:\narticle_id=38 parent_company='Zenith Copper Corp.' parent_company_ticker=['TSX:ZCC'] child_company='Andean Metals S.A.' child_company_ticker=None deal_amount='1.4 billion' deal_currency='USD' article_type='acquisition'",
