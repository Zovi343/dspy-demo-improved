For each piece of information:\n   - **Parent Company**: Extract the name of the company that is acquiring another company. This is typically mentioned first in the context of the acquisition.\n   - **Child Company**: Extract the name of the company being acquired. This is typically mentioned after the parent company in the context of the acquisition.\n   - **Deal Amount**: Extract the monetary value of the deal. If the amount is given with a currency symbol, convert it to a numerical format followed by the word 'million' or 'billion' as appropriate. For example, '$410 mn' should be converted to '410 million'.\n   - **Deal Currency**: Determine the currency of the deal. If the currency symbol is just \"$\", assume it is USD.\n   - **Article Type**: This should always be 'acquisition' for this task.\n\n3. If any information is not explicitly mentioned in the text, return 'None' for that field.\n\n4. Format the extracted information as follows:\n   ```\n   article_id=<unique identifier>\n   parent_company='<extracted parent company>'\n   parent_company_ticker=None\n   child_company='<extracted child company>'\n   child_company_ticker=None\n   deal_amount='<formatted deal amount>'\n   deal_currency='<extracted or assumed currency>'\n   article_type='acquisition'\n   ```\n\n5. Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and formatted correctly according to the guidelines provided.\n\n6. Use the context of the text to make logical assumptions where necessary, such as assuming the currency is USD if only the \"$\" symbol is used.\n\nBy following these instructions, you will be able to extract and format the necessary information about acquisition deals accurately and consistently.",
